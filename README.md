# Machine Learning Final Project

This project aims to create an end-to-end solution for a machine learning problem, covering data analysis, model selection, and performance optimization. It was done as a final portfolio through Break Through Tech's virtual program. I chose to predict review scores of Airbnb listings using machine learning to understand what factors contribute to higher user satisfaction.

# Dataset
I use the Airbnb Dataset, which includes various features such as:

- name: Listing name
- description: Listing description
- neighborhood overview: Description of the neighborhood
- Additional listing details, which may be included after exploratory data analysis.
- The dataset is pre-labeled with the review_scores_value variable, representing the overall review score given by users.


# Solution Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis to understand data patterns, distributions, and feature correlations.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Model Selection: Evaluate several regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess performance.
- Model Optimization: Apply hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature selection for model improvement.
- Portfolio Creation: Document and present findings and insights through visualizations and a project summary.

# Technologies Used
Programming languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for EDA), and ML libraries used for modeling
